            <br>
            This website will auto-generate graphs comparing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between countries.
            <br><br>
            This website uses
            <a href=https://github.com/Financial-Times/coronavirus-excess-mortality-data">the FT's data</a>.
            However, the code for generating the graphs was written by Alex Waygood,
            and is in no way affiliated with the FT.
